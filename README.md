# BioHackrXiv SWAT4HCLS BioHackathon project write up

This repository can be converted into a preview PDF with BioHackrXiv [Preview Server](http://preview.biohackrxiv.org/).
The preview website asks for the link to your repository and will automatically find the `paper.md` and create an PDF.

(In case you wonder why there is an author "no one else", that is because the platform does not support articles with
only one author.)
